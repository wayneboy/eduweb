            <p class="lead">Language shop is a small owner operated language school . 
                At language shop we want you to have success in learing a language , 
                unlike other schools you will not just plod through a text book with a teacher who just speaks the language where you will learn a few words and sentances. 
                At Language Shop our qualified and experienced teachers we will take you through a process that promotes real learing and enjoyment where you will be able to use the language in an increasing number of situations.
